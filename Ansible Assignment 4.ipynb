    "\n",
    "Inventories: These are a list of nodes containing their respective IP addresses, servers, databases, etc. which needs to be managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Just like any other API, the Ansible APIs are used for commuting various Cloud services, public or private services.\n",

    "\n",
    "Plugins: If you want to execute Ansible tasks as a job, Ansible Plugins can be used. They simplify the execution of a task by building a job like an environment that basically contains pieces of code corresponding to some specific functionality. There are 100s of Plugins provided by Ansible. An example is the Action plugin, which acts as front ends to modules and can execute tasks on the controller before calling the modules themselves.\n",

    "Networking: Ansible can also be used to automate different networks and services. It can do this by creating a playbook or an Ansible role that easily spans different network hardware.\n",

    "CMDB: It is a database that acts as a storehouse for various IT installations. It holds data about various IT assets (also known as configuration items (CI)) and describes the relationships between such assets.\n",
